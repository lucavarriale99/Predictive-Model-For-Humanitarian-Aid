## Predictive Models for Humanitarian Aid

This project addresses the escalating threats to peace and development in the Sahel region due to political and social conflicts. It introduces an experimental initiative for a comprehensive early warning system, leveraging historical data and aligning with Sustainable Development Goals. The project involves dataset creation, causal data augmentation, and model deployment, with a focus on predicting fatalities at the country level. Using Machine Learning models like XGBoost and causal data augmentation aims to enhance model robustness, emphasizing the significance of calibration for confident decision-making in preventing catastrophic events.

## How to experiment
Run the notebook demo_final.ipynb to see the effects of causal data augmentation over the prediction of fatalities and over calibration.
## Exploring ACLED
With the notebook acled_data_exploration.ipynb it is possible to explore data about fatalities and unrest in the Sahel region, with valuable insights over the kind of data that predictive models have to manage.
## The dashboard
Run dashboard.ipynb to see the results of the prediction of your run visualised, with possibilities of interaction.
